Vavineda
========

Hey!

Vaavineda is a fun, text-based adventure game that I wrote in Ruby. 

The code is extremely simple to follow and anyone can contribute, add levels, or buff up the game engine. I'm open to comments, suggestions and I'd love to see the game grow. 

To get started install ruby. Fork this repo, clone it and run with "ruby start_game.rb"

Feel free to add stuff and send in those pull requests!

Note: I learnt Ruby writing this game and I apologize for any crappiness.

Enjoy!
